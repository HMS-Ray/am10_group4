For our data visualization report, we are going to study global temperature change.
Following questions :
1.	The seasonal temperature trend
2.	Find the coolest and hottest place in each country
3.	Examine whether there is a relationship between average temperature and GDP
â€¦
We find our data set on Kaggle. 
- [Climate Change](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) 
This dataset reports on land and ocean temperature by the subsets country, state, and major cities as well as weather observations.
Besides, to analyze temperature change in country level, we need other data from world bank reporting the GDP, energy consumption and worldwide meat consumption data. 
- [GDP Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
- [Energy Consumption](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE)
- [Meat Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/meatconsumption)


For the statistical techniques, we may use linear regression for finding important figures related to temperature change. We may also use classification to find the similar pattern of changing among countries.
